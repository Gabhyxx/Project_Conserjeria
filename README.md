# Hotel Mercado del Carmen problem reporter

This is a webpage for the ESMAL3 Bootcamp. We created a problem reporter, where our customers can report any issue by giving a small description, a date and the room number. But not only you can read and create, you can also delete any report and update existing reports. All the data is storaged in a LOCAL database. We used the design pattern MVC for this project.
